# hsfm-geomorph
Using HSFM DEMs to understand decadal-scale geomorphology in the PNW.

All python scripts/notebooks in the repository depend on a local, large dataset. Note the `data_dir` variable set at the beginning of all scripts/notebooks.

The data can be downloaded by running the `download-data.sh` script. If you haven't run the script before, you'll need to make it an executable.

```
chmod +x download-data.sh
./download-data.sh
```
