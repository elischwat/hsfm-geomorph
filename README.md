# hsfm-geomorph
Using HSFM (historical structure from motion) DEMs to understand decadal-scale geomorphology in the PNW.

This library is composed of a number of scripts that you can run to analyze DEMs and produce plots, as published in the paper

https://doi.org/10.1016/j.geomorph.2023.108805

To run the scripts, you need the dataset. You can download the dataset here:

___

Once you have the dataset downloaded (and uncompressed, if it came compressed), you are ready to run the scripts. 

Run the scripts as shown in the run_all.sh script.
